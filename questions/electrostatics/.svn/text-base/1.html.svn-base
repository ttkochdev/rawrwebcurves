A positive charge is placed at rest at the center of a region of space in which there is a uniform, three-dimensional electric field. (A uniform field is one whose strength and direction are the same at all points within the region.) When the positive charge is released from rest in the uniform electric field, what will its subsequent motion be?<br>
<input type='radio' name='electr_1' value='a'>It will move at constant speed.</input><br>
<input type='radio' name='electr_1' value='b'>It will move at constant velocity.</input><br>
<input type='radio' name='electr_1' value='c'>It will move at constant acceleration.</input><br>
<input type='radio' name='electr_1' value='d'>It will move with linearly changing acceleration.</input><br>
<input type='radio' name='electr_1' value='e'>It will remain at rest in its initial position.</input>
