The figure below shows a hollow conducting metal sphere which was given initially an evenly distributed positive (+) charge on its surface. Then a positive charge +Q was brought up near the sphere as shown. What is the direction of the electric field at the center of the sphere after the positive charge +Q is brought up near the sphere?<br>
