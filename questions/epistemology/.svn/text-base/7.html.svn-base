<b>Julia: I like the way science explains things I see in the real world.<br>
Carla: I know that's what we're "supposed" to think, and it's true for many things. But let's face it, the science that explains things we do in lab at school can't really explain earthquakes, for instance. Scientific laws work well in some situations but not in most situations.<br>
Julia: I still think science applies to almost all real-world experiences. If we can't figure out how, it's because the stuff is very complicated, or because we don't know enough science yet.<br></b>
